# Personal Statement

#### What impact do you want to have on the world and why?

I want to be an extraordinary software engineer who makes applications or new features for some products. I expect that I could contribute to some product that provide millions of people with convenience and happiness.

There are thousands of web applications and desktop applications that take an active part of people's life. They make our life colorful and bind the world through the Internet. As for a user who is enjoying these conveniences every day, I'm not only want to be a user, but also a contributor of these products, to help other people improve their quality of life, and to make the world better. If I could see the happy faces when they use my product, I would be so proud of myself.

I feel confident that I'm ready for this job. Those courses, projects in computer science build a solid academic foundation in problem solving and programming. Those team works I have taken makes me a good "team player" to develop software. Those researches I have handled, give me the responsibility and leadership. Also, my learning ability makes me calm when I face some new challenges.

Since my target is clear and I am also well-prepared for it, the next step is to improve myself to find an opportunity to fulfill my dream.
